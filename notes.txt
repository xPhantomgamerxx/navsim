Change number of scenes in navtest scene filter here: /home/ubuntu/project_ws/navsim/navsim/planning/script/config/common/train_test_split/scene_filter/navtest.yaml

for visualization:
    check the pose of the ego vehicle in /home/ubuntu/project_ws/navsim/navsim/visualization/bev.py 
    relative pose calculated wrong in /home/ubuntu/project_ws/navsim/navsim/visualization/plots.py


Challenging scenarios: 
    df240e44ad0d5c3c, rainy conditions and car ahead badly visible
    f1dabe118a6955d6, fails, even though it looks like its fine, maybe predict too far movement?
