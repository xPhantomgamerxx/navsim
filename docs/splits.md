# Dataset splits vs. filtered training / test splits

The NAVSIM framework utilizes several dataset splits for standardized training and evaluating agents. 
All of them use the OpenScene dataset that is divided into the dataset splits `mini`,`trainval`,`test`,`private_test_e2e`, which can all be downloaded separately.

It is possible to run trainings and evaluations directly on these sets (see `Standard` in table below). 
Alternatively, you can run trainings and evaluations on training and validation splits that were filtered for challenging scenarios (see `NAVSIM` in table below), which is the recommended option for producing comparable and competitive results efficiently.
In contrast to the dataset splits which refer to a downloadable set of logs, the training / test splits are implemented as scene filters, which define how scenes are extracted from these logs.

The NAVSIM training / test splits subsample the OpenScene dataset splits.
Moreover, the NAVSIM splits include overlapping scenes, while the Standard splits are non-overlapping.
Specifically, `navtrain` is based on the `trainval` data and `navtest` on the `test` data.

As the `trainval` sensor data is very large, we provide a separate download link, which loads only the frames needed for `navtrain`. 
This eases access for users that only want to run the `navtrain` split and not the `trainval` split. If you already downloaded the full `trainval` sensor data, it is **not necessary** to download the `navtrain` frames as well.
The logs are always the complete dataset split.

## Overview
The Table belows offers an overview on the training and test splits supported by NAVSIM. 
In Navsim-v1.1, the training/test split can bet set with a single config parameter given in the table.

## Splits

The standard splits `trainval`, `test`, and `mini` are from the OpenScene dataset. Note that the data corresponds to the nuPlan dataset with a lower frequency of 2Hz. You can download all standard splits over Hugging Face with the bash scripts in [download](../download)

NAVSIM provides a subset and filter of the `trainval` split, called `navtrain`. The `navtrain` split facilitates a standardized training scheme and requires significantly less sensor data storage than `travel` (445GB vs. 2100GB). If your agents don't need historical sensor inputs, you can download `navtrain` without history, which requires 300GB of storage. Note that `navtrain` can be downloaded separately via [download_navtrain.sh](https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim/blob/main/download/download_navtrain.sh) but still requires access to the `trainval` logs. Similarly, the `navtest` split enables a standardized set for testing agents with a provided scene filter. Both `navtrain` and `navtest` are filtered to increase interesting samples in the sets. 

For the challenge on Hugging Face, we provide the `warmup_test_e2e` and `private_test_e2e` for the warm-up and challenge track, respectively. Note that `private_test_e2e` requires you to download the data, while `warmup_test_e2e` is a scene filter for the `mini` split.


## Troubleshooting

As previous users reported missing files when downloading `navtrain`, we provide MD5 checksums for the `.tgz` files to identify corrupted downloads. We recommend to re-download `navtrain` without deleting the `.tgz` files (i.e. removing Line 12 and 22 in [download_navtrain.sh](https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim/blob/main/download/download_navtrain.sh)) and running:

```bash 
echo "6f92f38d5f03ed852da7872a7122bdd2  navtrain_current_1.tgz" | md5sum -c -
echo "7a72f0a758b5df6cbe4c565920a4869f  navtrain_current_2.tgz" | md5sum -c -
